## ProtoBus

ProtoBus is a persistant-actor model microservice bus written in Golang.

### Okay, what does it do?

ProtoBus is a library framework that makes it easy for developers to create microservices and wire them together. By wiring your microservices through ProtoBus you gain hassle-free, asynchronous task management and a load of already existing actors to wire up to.

## Building and Testing
